**# Palworld Restart Kook Bot Notification**
* A simple restart script for palworld server and notification tool with kook on Windows. As knows the dedicated server for Palworld is using huge memory affecting the experience for online gaming.  
* I wrote this script for restart the server and send to nofication to Kook (If you need). I am low-level programmer with GPT help me finish this. Please don't mind any error or bug inside the script.  
* Requirements:  
Python 3.10 (requests,urllib.parse,psutil,time,datetime,subprocess)  
* Variable:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| token | Your_Bot_Token |
| target_id | 频道id |
| guild_id | 公会id |

Usage (only on Windows):
1. You can get the target id and guild_id when runing the script at first. And you can get the data like this (press ctrl+c to stop):
